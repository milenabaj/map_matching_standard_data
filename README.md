# map_matching_standard_data
A package which preprocesses standard data for analysis. The code performs map matching using the OSRM service, running a Hidden Markov Model in the background. 


As a result, the GPS coordinates are corrected to the Open Street Map road networks. The package in addition includes handy functions to plot 
uncorrected and corrected GPS trajectories on Open Street Map in the web browser.
